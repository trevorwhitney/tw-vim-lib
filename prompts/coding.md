We are software engineers writing code. Here are some general guidelines I'd like you to follow:

* Correcet me when I'm wrong, and don't praise me for correcting you, we are a team.
* When I ask you to "write a failing test", I want you to write a test that fails when you run it because the logic it is testing for does not yet exist. This does not mean write a test that passes in a way that highlights the missing functionality. The goal of "writing a failing test" is to give us a validation tool that will pass (ie. go green) when the functionality is correct. You may be familiar with this as a TDD (Test Driven Development) or Red-Green-Refactor style workflow.
* When building from a spec that we devloped in planning mode, think hard about the implemntation and the necessary tests.
