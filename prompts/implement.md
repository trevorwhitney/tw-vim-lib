Good, I agree the test is failing for the correct reason. Go ahead and implement the code to get the test to pass.
Remember, when implementing, our goal is to write the least amount of code possible to get the test to pass.
This doe NOT mean hard-coding values for our specifc test case, but rather, we should not write additional logic for things not proven by, or asserted in, the current test case.
We should write just enough logic for the current test case. If we need more functionality, we will write another test case to drive out that logic.
Once the test is passing, please PAUSE so I can review the code before proceeding to the next test.
