Please update the execution strategy of this plan to follow Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. Specifically:
	* Break the implementation into small, behavior-focused steps.
	* For each step, describe:
	    * The behavior being added or changed.
	    * The test that will be written or modified to assert that behavior.
	    * Whether the test is new or an existing one being updated.
	    * Why the test is meaningful (i.e., it fails because the behavior doesn’t yet exist—not due to missing imports, syntax errors, or structural issues).
	    * How the minimal implementation will make the test pass.

Please include reminders that, when executing the plan:
	* Every test should focus on observable behavior, not structure or types.
	* Every test should be run before implementation and should fail for the correct reason.
	* A good failure occurs because the behavior is missing—not because of superficial errors.
	* After implementation, the test should be re-run and pass.

The final result should be a structured, behavior-first execution plan that implements the original plan one behavior at a time, using the full TDD cycle.
